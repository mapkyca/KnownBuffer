Buffer Support for Known
==========================

This plugin provides Buffer syndication (POSSE) support for Known articles, status updates and images.

This is a meta-POSSE that will post, according to your buffer schedule, to all social media accounts. This 
lets you queue up tweets etc (until native embargo support is added).

Installation
------------

* Drop the Linkedin folder into the IndoPlugins folder of your idno installation.
* Log into known and click on Administration.
* Click "install" on the plugins page
